                        Finished secondary school with 11 A-C GCSES.
                        Whilst frequenting this secondary school for 5 years, I was took part in the cheerleading team, where we was able 
                        compete with other teams and win medals. This experience showed me how important it is to work in a team because it required 
                        alot of team effort and team confidence to conduct difficult and dangerous stunts.
                        Also, during my time in this secondary school, i took part in a business and enterprise competition where my team and I 
                        created a service where it generated a healthy food to tackle diet related diseases. This concept helped us to win the competition
                        where we was able to represent the UK and compete with other countries in Austria Vienna, and won the silver award. We was also 
                        able to go to New york to pitch our idea to other investors.
